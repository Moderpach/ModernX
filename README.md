## Installation

Locate your MPV folder. It is typically located at `\%APPDATA%\mpv\` on Windows and `~/.config/mpv/` on Linux/MacOS. See the [Files section](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#files) in mpv's manual for more info.

> [!NOTE]
> Create these folders if you don't have them already

Place `modernx.lua` into your mpv `scripts/` folder, remove any previous OSC scripts.

Then place the two fonts in the `fonts/` folder.
